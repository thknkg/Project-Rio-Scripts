'''
Intended to parse "decoded" files which would be present on a user's computer

How to use:
- import RioStatLib obviously
- open a Rio stat json file
- convert from json string to obj using json.loads(jsonStr)
- create StatObj with your stat json obj using the following:
	myStats = RioStatLib.StatObj(jsonObj)
- call any of the built-in methods to get some stats

- ex:
	import RioStatLib
	import json
	with open("path/to/RioStatFile.json", "r") as jsonStr:
		jsonObj = json.loads(jsonStr)
		myStats = RioStatLib.StatObj(jsonObj)
		homeTeamOPS = myStats.ops(0)
		awayTeamSLG = myStats.slg(1)
		booERA = myStats.era(0, 4) # Boo in this example is the 4th character on the home team

Team args:
- arg == 0 means team0 which is the home team
- arg == 1 means team1 which is the away team
- arg == -1 or no arg provided means both teams (if function allows) (none currently accept this, but it might be added in the future)

Roster args:
- arg == 0 -> 8 for each of the 9 roster spots
- arg == -1 or no arg provided means all characters on that team (if function allows)

# teamNum: 0 == home team, 1 == away team
# rosterNum: optional (no arg == all characters on team), 0 -> 8 for each of the 9 roster spots
